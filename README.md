Developed an AI-based Industrial PPE Compliance Detection System using YOLOv8 and Deep Learning to detect safety equipment such as Helmet, Vest, Boots, Mask, Gloves, Goggles, and Person from images and webcam captures. The system is built using Python, PyTorch, OpenCV, Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, enabling real-time industrial safety monitoring through an interactive web interface.
